# SAF-packager

SAF-packager is a program for creating Simple Archive Format archives
(see
e.g. [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC6x/Importing+and+Exporting+Items+via+Simple+Archive+Format]). It
creates SAF archives from CSV-files and was developed for University
of Eastern Finland's DSpace-instance, but might be useful also for
others.

There is also another tool for the same purpose:
https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Simple+Archive+Format+Packager
which might be more suitable for generic purposes.
